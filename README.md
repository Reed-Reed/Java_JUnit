# Java_JUnit

**JUnit testing**
This program showcases implementation of JUnit to write unit tests. JUnit is a tool used to automate testing methods for Java. 
I wrote each file using Java best practices, including error handling and input validation. 

**What I could do better**

During the first week of coding this program I developed a console UI for the application because that is how I am used to testing.
I did not fully realize the power of JUnit allowed me to test methods and input validation without using a user interface. 
For the remaining files I did not develop a UI and was able to more easily implement unit testing. 
I would spend more time on designing the program before I jumped into the development phase.

**What I did well**

After I got a better handle on JUnit and using assertions, I was able to write concise and consistent methods and test them with JUnit files. 
The program has over 80% of code covered by JUnit testing, meaning my code was efficient and did not include uncessary lines or leave important lines untested.
I take pride in writing code that is easy to read, and leaving succinct comments that categorize methods.
